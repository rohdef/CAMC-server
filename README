*UPDATED*
Server broadcasts a packet every second by UDP on port 49155. This is so clients can find the server.
You should probably use Java's DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket for receiving. Use TCP sockets for sending.
The server triggers voting when half the duration of the final song of a playlist is done, by broadcasting on port 50032.
It can then receive votes on the same port. See DummyClient.

I tested the server with some clients on the same machine, I don't have the equipment to test it on a real network.
